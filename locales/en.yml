      Driven by technological innovations, tech companies are inventing new products
      and services every day. <strong>Traditional schools have a hard time climbing this step</strong>.
      Young graduates, eager to learn these new skills, don't have the necessary technical background
      to get recruiters' attention or to launch their own project.
    what_we_do: |
      Le Wagon wants to make these young <strong>talents</strong> become <strong>actors</strong> of this "tech" innovation.

      Object-oriented programming and typical design patterns (<strong>MVC</strong>, <strong>Page-Controller</strong>),
      the key notions to quickly grab a new framework.
      <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> helps you build prototypes very quickly to test any idea.
    database_and_js: |
      SQL database modeling, integration of <strong>open-source</strong> libraries
      (fileupload, geolocation, Oauth authentication, payment, etc)
      and client-side programming with <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Ajax</strong>.

      to dive into programming and, above all, change their <strong>mindset</strong>.

      thanks to these new abilities. Our unique goal is to make you reach this level.
    be_a_great_entreprener: Become an outstanding entrepreneur who is able to code his own projects and to deeply understand technical issues.
    find_a_job: Find a job in a tech company (as a developer, product manager, growth hacker, etc)
    why: WHY LE WAGON?
    rationale: |
      <p>Everybody can learn to code online.
      However, it can be long and painful. You spend hours on stack overflow
      while you have a thousand projects in mind.</p>
      <p>Our program will not only make you save 2 years, but
      will also <strong>teach you what you cannot learn online</strong>:
      how to start with a good set-up,
      to design your software architecture, to model your data, to apply best practices in your day-to-day work.</p>
      <p>To sum up,  <strong>you’ll learn how to start from a
      real-life problem and end with a technical solution</strong>.</p>
    join_the_community: JOIN THE COMMUNITY
    le_wagon_community: |
      <p>At the end of the program, you’ll know how to <strong>transform
      ideas into products</strong>, and you will already have <strong>several projects in your Github portfolio</strong>.</p>
      <p>You will also be part of a very active community: 160 former students,
      8 teachers, 15 coachs, 9 start-ups made in Le Wagon,
      world-class workshops every Thursday with inspiring entrepreneurs and CEOs,
      personal coaching session on your personal projects after the end of the program.</p>
      <p>Be prepared to join a community of passionate professionals, ready to help and to bring you new opportunities.</p>
    the_spirit: OUR SPIRIT
    le_wagon_spirit: |
      <p>On top of being experienced programmers, <strong>our teachers are also web entrepreneurs</strong> (Taster’s Club, Sylights, Txto, Le Wagon, Tinci, Pull Review).
      They  have a “ground experience” of programing and they know which concepts really matter.</p>
      <p>Every student is also followed by a personal coach, a professional
      developer who will give him guidelines on his personal project.</p>
      <p>Ah, and we do Yoga on Thursday's afternoon with Claire.
      Just to loosen up :)</p>
